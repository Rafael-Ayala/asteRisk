Changes in version 1.4.0 (2022-06-30)
+ Functions deg2rad(), rad2deg() and revDays2radMin() for conversion of units are provided

Changes in version 1.4.0 (2022-03-08)
+ Increased performance of readTLE when providing an URL
+ Function hpop() can now perform automatic changes of the celestial body used as the center of coordinates, therefore making it suitable to propagate the trajectory of any spacecraft in the Solar System, and not just those orbiting Earth
+ Added function JPLephemerides() to calculate JPL DE ephemerides including position and velocity of the Sun, main planets, Moon and Pluto of the Solar System

Changes in version 1.3.0 (2022-02-07)
+ Added an internal correction from UTC to UT1 before calculating GMST
+ Added correction to GMST when converting from TEME to other frames to apply kinematic terms of the Equation of equinoxes for dates after 1997
+ Explained in detail why date and time must be specified in some functions for conversion between reference frames
+ Now readTLE accepts argument maxTLEs to specify a maximum number of TLEs ro read from the file
+ Now functions to convert from TEME to ITRF or geodetic coordinates raise an error with an informative message if Earth orientation parameters for the specified date are not available
+ getLatestSpaceData() accepts a targets argument specifying the data that should be updated
+ Added support for OEM files through readOEM()
+ Updated Earth gravity model to GGM05C (previously, GGM03S was used)
+ Updated JPL Ephemeris to DE440
+ Greatly increased accuracy of ocean tide corrections to geopotential model. These now use the FES2014 model to include corrections up to degree and order 100
+ Now an anelastic Earth model is used to calculate solid Earth tide corrections
+ Function hpop() now accepts additional arguments to specify the degree and order of the geopotential model, and to specify if solid Earth and ocean tides corrections should be performed
+ Some internal functions are now written in C++ to enhance performance, and therefore the package now requires compilation

Changes in version 1.2.0 (2021-12-01)
+ Added functions to convert from geodetic latitude, longitude and altitude to ITRF and GCRF frames
+ ECEF frame has been renamed to ITRF, which was the actual ECEF frame in use by the relevant functions
+ Removed redundant internal functions and constants
+ Now actual Earth Orientation Parameters are used to calculate polar motion matrices
+ Corrections to the space weather parameters used by the NRLMSISE-00 model have been applied
+ Fixed bug when reading fields of RINEX GLONASS navigation files
+ Functions to read RINEX navigation files now perform correction of ephemeris times to UTC, according to each GNSS specifications
+ readGPSNavigationRINEX now also calculated the ephemeris in Cartesian coordinates in ECEF frame
+ Fixed error in documentation that erroneously indicated GLONASS ephemerides were in GCRF frame (when they are actually in ECEF frame)
+ Multiple bugs in SGP4/SDP4 implementations fixed, and changes introduced in Revisiting Space Track Report #3 have also been added
+ Added a description of a simple way to calcualte a good estimate of the effective area of a satellite in the manual page for hpop()

Changes in version 1.1.0 (2021-07-05)
+ Added functions to read RINEX navigation files for GPS and GLONASS satellites
+ Changed vignette to avoid errors due to lack of PhantomJS

Changes in version 1.0.0 (2021-05-02)
+ Added a high-precision numerical orbital propagator
+ Added support for more frames of reference: GCRF and Keplerian orbital elements
+ More functions to convert between the different coordinate frames are available

Changes in version 0.99.1 (2021-03-22)
+ Fixed DESCRIPTION format
+ Fixed a bug in the conversion from TEME to ECEF frames of reference
+ Added conversion to geodesic latitude, longitude and altitude

Changes in version 0.99.0 (2021-03-21)
+ First version
+ Submitted to CRAN
