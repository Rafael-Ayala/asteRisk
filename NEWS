Changes in version 1.3.9999 (2022-XX-XX)
+ Added an internal correction from UTC to UT1 before calculating GMST
+ Added correction to GMST when converting from TEME to other frames to apply kinematic terms of the Equation of equinoxes for dates after 1997
+ Explained in detail why date and time must be specified in some functions for conversion between reference frames
+ Now readTLE accepts argument maxTLEs to specify a maximum number of TLEs ro read from the file
+ Now functions to convert from TEME to ITRF or geodetic coordinates raise an error with an informative message if Earth orientation parameters for the specified date are not available
+ getLatestSpaceData() accepts a targets argument specifying the data that should be updated

Changes in version 1.2.0 (2021-12-01)
+ Added functions to convert from geodetic latitude, longitude and altitude to ITRF and GCRF frames
+ ECEF frame has been renamed to ITRF, which was the actual ECEF frame in use by the relevant functions
+ Removed redundant internal functions and constants
+ Now actual Earth Orientation Parameters are used to calculate polar motion matrices
+ Corrections to the space weather parameters used by the NRLMSISE-00 model have been applied
+ Fixed bug when reading fields of RINEX GLONASS navigation files
+ Functions to read RINEX navigation files now perform correction of ephemeris times to UTC, according to each GNSS specifications
+ readGPSNavigationRINEX now also calculated the ephemeris in Cartesian coordinates in ECEF frame
+ Fixed error in documentation that erroneously indicated GLONASS ephemerides were in GCRF frame (when they are actually in ECEF frame)
+ Multiple bugs in SGP4/SDP4 implementations fixed, and changes introduced in Revisiting Space Track Report #3 have also been added
+ Added a description of a simple way to calcualte a good estimate of the effective area of a satellite in the manual page for hpop()

Changes in version 1.1.0 (2021-07-05)
+ Added functions to read RINEX navigation files for GPS and GLONASS satellites
+ Changed vignette to avoid errors due to lack of PhantomJS

Changes in version 1.0.0 (2021-05-02)
+ Added a high-precision numerical orbital propagator
+ Added support for more frames of reference: GCRF and Keplerian orbital elements
+ More functions to convert between the different coordinate frames are available

Changes in version 0.99.1 (2021-03-22)
+ Fixed DESCRIPTION format
+ Fixed a bug in the conversion from TEME to ECEF frames of reference
+ Added conversion to geodesic latitude, longitude and altitude

Changes in version 0.99.0 (2021-03-21)
+ First version
+ Submitted to CRAN
