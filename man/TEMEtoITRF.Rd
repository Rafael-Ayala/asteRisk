\title{Convert coordinates from TEME to ITRF
}
\description{
The TEME (True Equator, Mean Equinox) frame of reference is an Earth-centered
inertial coordinate frame, where the origin is placed at the center of mass
of Earth and the coordinate frame is fixed with respect to the stars (and
therefore not fixed with respect to the Earth surface in its rotation). The
coordinates and velocities calculated with the SGP4 and SDP4 models are in the
TEME frame of reference. This function converts positions and velocities in
TEME to the ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame), which is an ECEF 
(Earth Centered, Earth Fixed) frame of reference. In the ITRF, the origin is 
also placed at the center of mass of Earth, but the frame rotates with respect 
to the stars to remain fixed with respect to the Earth surface as it rotates. 
The Z-axis extends along the true North as defined by the IERS reference pole, 
and the X-axis extends towards the intersection between the equator and the 
Greenwich meridian at any time.

This function requires the \code{asteRiskData} package, which can be installed 
by running \code{install.packages('asteRiskData', repos='https://rafael-ayala.github.io/drat/')}

\usage{
TEMEtoITRF(position_TEME, velocity_TEME, dateTime)
}
\arguments{
  \item{position_TEME}{Vector with the X, Y and Z components of the position
  of an object in TEME frame, in m.
  }
  \item{velocity_TEME}{Vector with the X, Y and Z components of the velocity
  of an object in TEME frame, in m/s.
  }
  \item{dateTime}{Date-time string with the date and time in UTC corresponding
  to the provided position and velocity vectors. This specifies the time for 
  which the conversion from TEME to ITRF coordinates will be performed. It is
  important to provide an accurate value, since the point over the surface of
  Earth to which a set of TEME coordinates refers varies with time due to
  the motion of Earth.
  }
}
\value{
A list with two elements representing the position and velocity of the satellite
in the ITRF (International Terrestrial Reference Frame) frame of reference. 
Position values are in m, and velocity values are in m/s. Each of the two 
elements contains three values, corresponding to the X, Y and Z components of 
position and velocity in this order.
